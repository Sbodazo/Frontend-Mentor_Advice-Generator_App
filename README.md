## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon


<!-- ### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)


### What I learned

In this project I forced myself to use Typescript for the code and Grid for the style. Using them was surely fun in the small scope of this project, I just hope I didn't over-complicate things. I guess I'll learn along the way, when I will become confident enough.

A small animation for the dice when you click it:
```css
@keyframes spin {
  0% {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  5% {
    transform: rotate(-10deg);
  }
  20% {
    transform: rotate(-60deg);
  }
  70% {
    transform: rotate(400deg);
  }
  100% {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I surely want to improve myself with CSS Grid. It surely is a powerful layout tool that can help a lot with responsive layouts. I know I can also improve in more standard CSS properties and best-practices.

Another source of improvement is Typescript: I know it's widely use and that can be really useful in much bigger projects. I know that in these types of projects it's definitely overkill, but learning it in small chunks can help me better understand the overall structure and concepts.
